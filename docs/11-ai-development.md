# ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development Guide

This document provides guidelines and tools for using AI assistance effectively in the ValkyrieVault project.

## üéØ Overview

This project is designed to be **LLM-friendly**, enabling developers to leverage AI assistance for:

- Code generation and review
- Infrastructure planning and optimization
- Documentation improvement
- Troubleshooting and debugging
- Security analysis and hardening

## üß† AI Context System

### Master AI Prompt

Use this comprehensive prompt to provide full context to any LLM when working on this project:

```markdown
[Copy the content from .ai/context-prompt.md below]
```

### Quick Context Files

For specific tasks, use these focused context files:

| File                             | Purpose                        | Use Case                        |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| `.ai/terraform-context.md`       | Terraform/OpenTofu development | Infrastructure changes          |
| `.ai/docker-context.md`          | Container configuration        | Docker/compose modifications    |
| `.ai/security-context.md`        | Security implementations       | Security features and hardening |
| `.ai/deployment-context.md`      | Deployment automation          | CI/CD and deployment scripts    |
| `.ai/troubleshooting-context.md` | Problem diagnosis              | Debugging and issue resolution  |

## üõ†Ô∏è AI Development Workflow

### 1. Starting a New Task

```bash
# Load project context for your AI assistant
cat .ai/context-prompt.md

# For specific domains, add focused context
cat .ai/terraform-context.md  # For infrastructure work
cat .ai/docker-context.md     # For container work
cat .ai/security-context.md   # For security work
```

### 2. AI-Assisted Code Review

```bash
# Generate AI review checklist
./scripts/ai-code-review.sh your-branch-name

# AI security analysis
./scripts/ai-security-check.sh
```

### 3. Documentation Generation

```bash
# AI-assisted documentation updates
./scripts/ai-docs-update.sh module-name

# Generate README updates
./scripts/ai-readme-sync.sh
```

## üìã AI Assistance Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ

- **Always provide full project context** via the master prompt
- **Specify exact versions** of tools and technologies in use
- **Include relevant configuration files** in your AI conversations
- **Request code that follows project conventions** (S.O.L.I.D, Clean Code)
- **Ask for security-first implementations**
- **Request comprehensive error handling**

### Don'ts ‚ùå

- **Don't assume AI knows project specifics** without context
- **Don't accept generic solutions** - request project-tailored code
- **Don't skip security considerations** in AI-generated code
- **Don't bypass established workflows** even with AI assistance
- **Don't commit AI code without review** and testing

### AI Prompt Templates

#### For Infrastructure Changes

```
Given the ValkyrieVault project context above, I need to [specific task].

Requirements:
- Use OpenTofu 1.6.0 syntax
- Follow our S3 backup strategy pattern
- Include appropriate tags and naming conventions
- Ensure security best practices
- Support multi-environment (dev/staging/prod)

The change should integrate with our existing modules in terraform/modules/ and follow the established patterns for [specific area].
```

#### For Docker/Container Work

```
Based on the project context, I need to [specific container task].

Requirements:
- Use Alpine Linux base images where possible
- Follow security-first container practices (non-root user, read-only filesystem)
- Include proper health checks
- Use our established networking patterns
- Support our multi-environment setup
- Include monitoring/logging capabilities

The solution should integrate with our existing docker-compose configurations.
```

#### For Security Implementation

```
Using the project security context, I need to implement [security feature].

Requirements:
- Follow defense-in-depth principles
- Use encryption standards from our security guide
- Include comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Support our compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC 2)
- Integrate with existing security tools (fail2ban, ufw, etc.)
- Include incident response procedures

Please provide implementation with security rationale.
```

BRANCH=${1:-$(git branch --show-current)}
echo "ü§ñ AI-assisted code review for branch: $BRANCH"

# Generate diff for AI review
git diff main...$BRANCH > /tmp/changes.diff

echo "üìã AI Code Review Checklist:"
echo "1. Load project context (.ai/context-prompt.md)"
echo "2. Provide the following diff to your AI:"
echo "----------------------------------------"
cat /tmp/changes.diff
echo "----------------------------------------"
echo ""
