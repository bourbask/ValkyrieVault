## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project is **LLM-friendly** and designed to work seamlessly with AI development assistants.

### Quick AI Context Loading

```bash
# Load complete project context for your AI assistant
./scripts/ai-context.sh full

# Load specific context for your development task
./scripts/ai-context.sh terraform    # Infrastructure work
./scripts/ai-context.sh docker      # Container development
./scripts/ai-context.sh security    # Security implementation
./scripts/ai-context.sh deployment  # CI/CD and deployment
./scripts/ai-context.sh troubleshoot # Debugging assistance
```

### AI Development Workflow

1. **Load Context**: Use `./scripts/ai-context.sh <type> --copy` to copy context to clipboard
2. **Paste to AI**: Provide the context to your AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
3. **Request Help**: Ask for code generation, review, or troubleshooting assistance
4. **Follow Standards**: AI responses follow our established coding standards and security practices

### Available AI Features

| Feature          | Command                                    | Description                    |

| **Stats**        | `./scripts/ai-context.sh security --stats` | View context statistics        |

### Example AI Workflow

```bash
# 1. Load Terraform context for infrastructure changes
./scripts/ai-context.sh terraform --copy

# 2. Paste context into your AI assistant and ask:
# "I need to add a new backup retention policy for development environment.
#  Please provide Terraform code following the project patterns."

# 3. AI will provide code that follows:
#   - Project naming conventions
#   - Security best practices
#   - Multi-environment patterns
#   - Proper resource tagging
```

See [**AI Development Guide**](docs/11-ai-development.md) for comprehensive AI assistance documentation.
