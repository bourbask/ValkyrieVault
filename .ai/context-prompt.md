## 🎨 Coding Standards & Conventions

### General Principles

1. **S.O.L.I.D. Principles**: All code must follow SOLID design principles
2. **Clean Code**: Readable, maintainable, well-documented code
3. **Security First**: Every solution must prioritize security
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything must be version-controlled and reproducible
5. **Documentation**: All code must be documented with examples

### Language-Specific Standards

#### Terraform/HCL

```hcl
# Use consistent naming: environment-project-resource-purpose
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "vaultwarden_prod_backups_primary" {
  bucket = "${var.project_name}-${var.environment}-backups-${random_id.suffix.hex}"

  tags = {
    Environment = var.environment
    Project     = var.project_name
    Purpose     = "backup-storage"
    ManagedBy   = "terraform"
  }
}

# Always use variables, never hardcode
variable "backup_retention_days" {
  description = "Backup retention configuration by type"
  type = object({
    hourly  = number
    daily   = number
    monthly = number
    yearly  = number
  })

  validation {
    condition = alltrue([
      var.backup_retention_days.hourly >= 1,
      var.backup_retention_days.daily >= 7,
      var.backup_retention_days.monthly >= 1,
      var.backup_retention_days.yearly >= 1
    ])
    error_message = "Retention periods must meet minimum requirements."
  }
}
```

#### Docker/YAML

```yaml
# Always specify exact versions
services:
  vaultwarden:
    image: vaultwarden/server:1.30.1 # Never use 'latest'

    # Security: always run as non-root
    user: "65534:65534"

    # Security: read-only filesystem where possible
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp

    # Security: drop all capabilities, add only needed
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    cap_add:
      - SETUID
      - SETGID

    # Always include resource limits
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 512M
          cpus: "1.0"
        reservations:
          memory: 256M
          cpus: "0.5"

    # Comprehensive health checks
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:80/alive"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 40s
```

#### Shell Scripts

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Always use strict mode
set -euo pipefail

# Function-based architecture with error handling
backup_database() {
    local source_db="$1"
    local backup_path="$2"
    local timestamp="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"

    echo "🔄 Starting database backup at $timestamp"

    # Validate inputs
    if [[ ! -f "$source_db" ]]; then
        echo "❌ Source database not found: $source_db" >&2
        return 1
    fi

    # Perform backup with error checking
    if sqlite3 "$source_db" ".backup $backup_path"; then
        echo "✅ Database backup completed: $backup_path"
        return 0
    else
        echo "❌ Database backup failed" >&2
        return 1
    fi
}
```

### Naming Conventions

#### Resources

- **AWS Resources**: `{project}-{environment}-{service}-{purpose}`
- **Docker Containers**: `{service}_{environment}` or `vw_{service}`
- **Volumes**: `{service}_data`, `{service}_config`
- **Networks**: `{project}_{environment}_net`

#### Files & Directories

- **Terraform**: `snake_case` for resources and variables
- **Scripts**: `kebab-case.sh`
- **Documentation**: `##-title.md` (numbered for ordering)
- **Configs**: `.{service}.{format}` (e.g., `.env`, `.nginx.conf`)

#### Variables & Secrets

- **Environment Variables**: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`
- **Terraform Variables**: `snake_case`
- **Secret Names**: `{project}-{environment}-{purpose}`

## 🔒 Security Requirements

### Mandatory Security Practices

1. **No Hardcoded Secrets**: All secrets via AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables
2. **Encryption Everywhere**: Data at rest and in transit must be encrypted
3. **Least Privilege**: Minimal permissions for all components
4. **Network Segmentation**: Proper firewall and network controls
5. **Container Security**: Non-root users, read-only filesystems, capability restrictions
6. **Audit Logging**: All administrative actions must be logged

### Security Validations Required

- [ ] No secrets in code (use `detect-secrets`)
- [ ] Container security scan passes (Trivy)
- [ ] Infrastructure security scan passes (Checkov)
- [ ] Network security properly configured
- [ ] Backup encryption working and tested
- [ ] Access controls implemented and tested

## 🚀 Deployment Patterns

### GitOps Workflow

```
Developer → Feature Branch → PR → Review → Merge → Auto-Deploy
```

### Deployment Strategies by Environment

- **Development**: Recreate deployment (fast iteration)
- **Staging**: Blue-Green deployment (production-like testing)
- **Production**: Blue-Green with canary testing (maximum safety)

### Required Checks Before Deployment

1. **Security Scan**: No new vulnerabilities
2. **Integration Tests**: All tests pass
3. **Infrastructure Validation**: Terraform plan review
4. **Backup Verification**: Recent backups confirmed working
5. **Monitoring Ready**: Alerts and dashboards configured

## 🔧 Common Tasks & Patterns

### Adding New Infrastructure

1. Create Terraform module in `terraform/modules/`
2. Add to environment-specific configurations
3. Include security configurations and tags
4. Add monitoring and backup considerations
5. Update documentation with usage examples

### Container Service Addition

1. Create secure Dockerfile (non-root, health checks)
2. Add to docker-compose with security constraints
3. Configure networking and dependencies
4. Add monitoring endpoints
5. Include backup procedures if stateful

### Security Feature Implementation

1. Follow defense-in-depth principles
2. Include comprehensive logging
3. Add monitoring and alerting
4. Document security rationale
5. Include incident response procedures

### Example Interaction Pattern

```
Human: "I need to add Redis caching to improve performance"

AI Response:
## Solution Overview
Adding Redis as a caching layer with security-first configuration...

## Security Considerations
- Redis will run in Docker with authentication enabled
- Network access restricted to application containers only
- Data encryption in transit via TLS
- No persistence enabled (cache only) to reduce attack surface

## Implementation
[Detailed implementation with code]

## Testing
[Testing procedures]

## Monitoring
[Metrics and alerts to add]

## Documentation
[Documentation updates needed]
```
